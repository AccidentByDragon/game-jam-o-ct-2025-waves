  Nodes have been structured relatively freely, grouped the Spawning points for waves into groups based on the cardinal direction they are positioned inorder to locate them via
  a For loop in script, in the Node tree all waves spawn points are gathered under a "SpawnPoints" parent node to keep tree clearer
