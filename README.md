# READ ME
 this project was orignailly started as part of the "Game Off 2025" Game jam and as an opportunity to learn Godot by using it,
 however due ot other ocmmitments i realsied i was unlikely to complete the project in time and instead decided to simply use it as an opportunity to learn Godot and GDScript
 
## Game Off 2025
Game Off is an annual game jam challenging individuals and teams to build a game during the month of November. Use whatever programming languages, game engines, or libraries you like. 
This year's theme is WAVES. 

## Reflection and Thoughts
I learned a fair amount on Godot and its 2d functions, it may however have been mistake to launch myself into a project that involved the physics engine so much immediatly


## TODO
1. Add controls and instructions point in main menu
